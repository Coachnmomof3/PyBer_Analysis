# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this anaysis was to gather more insight on  rural, suburban, and urban city types using each cities fare cost per ride, count of rides and driver count.  With the knowledge gained come up with recomondations to eliminate and capitalize on addressed disprities.


## Results: 

I've developed a summary data frame to visualize the final results of our overall purpose of this project which was to analyze per city type and to see which one has the highest fare, driver count, total rides, and average.

### Analysis
- Rural:
  - The least amount of Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fare.
  - The highest Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver.
- Suburan:
  - The halfway point of the two spectrums. Nothing significant about these numbers given that a suburban city type is not an outlier rather lies in between.
- Urban:
  - The highest amount of total rides, total drivers, and total fare.
  - Had the smallest scale on average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

### Further Analysis
![PyBer_Fare_Summary](https://github.com/Coachnmomof3/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

In the above we can visually see the total fares by city type over the course of about four months in 2019. The Rural is at the bottom and Urban is at the top of the line chart. We see that fares decrease around the middle of February and go back up near the end of Februrary. All city types decrease in the beginning of March. Overall we see that Urban have the most random peaks while Suburban and Rural stay relatively consistant through April.

## Summary: 

### Recommendations

We want to ensure we provide options to include all city types leaving out any implicit bias. 

Recommendation one is to improve the rural city statistics by offering more incentives to drivers in these areas. Taking a ride will be more appealing to population in these areas due to the subsidy decreasing fares and the increase in drivers. Also taking note here that Rural cities had the highest Average Fare per Ride and Driver.

Second recommendation is to somehow decrease the amount of urban drivers since the numbers are hugly skewed. It is almost as if your are only operating in urban cities, which makes sense but we need to address other city types as well.

The final recommendation is to try to offer more promotions during months that have holidays. In March we saw a major decrease at the start for total fare. We would want customers to use PyBer when going out during St. Patricks day, specifically in suburban and rural cities. Our numbers should spike and we should capitalize on this holiday. Yet we did not see that for suburban and rural cities. I do understand that most of the population that live in these cities might have traveled to the urban areas but there was still activity in rural and suburban areas.

I believe that these three recomendations will assist in moving in the direction needed to eliminate and capitalize on addressed disprities among rural, suburban and urban cities.
